abstract = {Few studies explicitly link transport and social exclusion and yet there is increasing pressure from policy-makers in the UK to do so. We propose a conceptual framework which links the two and examine a selection of indicators which might be used in assessing the outcomes of policies designed to use increased mobility to reduce exclusion. An illustrative example of the use of London Transport's CAPITAL model is demonstrated to assess access to regeneration sites. We conclude that increasing access to activities and services requires combating individuals' constraints at either end of their journey in addition to transport system improvements. {\textcopyright} 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

It is a strategy that has been remarkably successful, enabling the sciences, social sciences and humanities to advance in leaps and bounds. This approach is presently being challenged by the development of big data. Small data studies will however, we argue, continue to be popular and valuable in the future because of their utility in answering targeted queries. Importantly, however, small data will increasingly be made more big data-like through the development of new data infrastructures that pool, scale and link small data in order to create larger datasets, encourage sharing and reuse, and open them up to combination with big data and analysis using big data analytics. This paper examines the logic and value of small data studies, their relationship to emerging big data and data science, and the implications of scaling small data into data infrastructures, with a focus on spatial data examples.},

abstract = {This paper analyses the influence of commuters' attitudes toward the benefits of travel by bicycle (e.g. convenience, low cost, health benefits) on the mode choice decision for commutes to work. We assume that when the commute journey intensifies, either in terms of distance or frequency, attitudes toward cycling become more positive. Factor analysis reveals three underlying attitudinal factors toward cycling to work: awareness, direct trip-based benefits and safety. The decision to cycle is influenced by the factor " direct trip-based benefit" at all distances, whereas the " awareness" is influential only over long distances. The decision to cycle every day is again affected by the " direct benefit" factor. The factors " safety" and " awareness" are important over shorter distances. Having a cycling habit increases the likelihood of cycling and a higher frequency of cycling. The perceived opinion of others only affects the mode choice over short distances suggesting indicates mode choice on longer commutes is based on one's own attitudes. These findings indicate that attitudes and other psychological factors have a relatively strong impact on the choice to commute by bicycle. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Lucas2012,
abstract = {The late 1990s and early 2000s witnessed a growing interest amongst UK academics and policy makers in the issue of transport disadvantage and, more innovatively, how this might relate to growing concerns about the social exclusion of low income groups and communities. Studies (predominantly in the United Kingdom) began to make more explicit the links policy between poverty, transport disadvantage, access to key services and economic and social exclusion (see for example Church and Frost, 2000; . TRaC, 2000; Lucas et al., 2001; Kenyon 2003; Kenyon et al., 2003; Hodgson and Turner, 2003; Raje, 2003).By 2003, the UK Social Exclusion Unit had published and its now internationally recognised report on this subject, which subsequently resulted in the development of a set of transport policy guidances to local authorities in England to deliver what is now commonly referred to as . accessibility planning as part of their Local Transport Plans (. Department for Transport, 2006). Since this time, researchers, policy makers and practitioners in several other countries became interested in adopting a social exclusion approach to transport planning, largely because of its utility in identifying the role of transport, land use planning and service delivery decisions in creating and reinforcing poverty and social disadvantage.Eight years on from the SEU report, we can begin to reflect on the extent to which a social exclusion approach to the research of transport disadvantage has been successful in opening up new avenues of research enquiry and/or identifying new theoretical perspectives and/or methodological approaches. The paper begins by briefly revisiting the basic theories and core definitions which underpin and inform a social exclusion perspective. It then considers how these have been translated and understood in terms of transport. Secondly, it considers some of the emergent empirical research of transport-related exclusion that has attempted to measure and model the interactions between transport and mobility inequalities and relational negative social outcomes. Thirdly, it offers observations on progress in some key areas of policy and practice, with specific reference to the UK and Australia. It concludes by suggesting how further progress might be made on this issue and considers whether the social exclusion agenda is still a relevant approach for achieving this. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Tribby2017,
abstract = {There is growing international evidence that supportive built environments encourage active travel such as walking. An unsettled question is the role of geographic regions for analyzing the relationship between the built environment and active travel. This paper examines the geographic region question by assessing walking trip models that use two different regions: walking activity spaces and self-defined neighborhoods. We also use two types of built environment metrics, perceived and audit data, and two types of study design, cross-sectional and longitudinal, to assess these regions. We find that the built environment associations with walking are dependent on the type of metric and the type of model. Audit measures summarized within walking activity spaces better explain walking trips compared to audit measures within self-defined neighborhoods. Perceived measures summarized within self-defined neighborhoods have mixed results. Finally, results differ based on study design. This suggests that results may not be comparable among different regions, metrics and designs; researchers need to consider carefully these choices when assessing active travel correlates.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Empirical evidence suggests that an association between the built environment and physical activity exists. This evidence is mostly derived from cross-sectional studies that do not account for other causal explanations such as neighborhood self-selection. Experimental and quasi-experimental designs can be used to isolate the effect of the built environment on physical activity, but in their absence, statistical techniques that adjust for neighborhood self-selection can be used with cross-sectional data. Previous reviews examining the built environment-physical activity relationship have not differentiated among findings based on study design. To deal with self-selection, we synthesized evidence regarding the relationship between objective measures of the built environment and physical activity by including in our review: 1) cross-sectional studies that adjust for neighborhood self-selection and 2) quasi-experiments.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHOD: In September 2010, we searched for English-language studies on built environments and physical activity from all available years in health, leisure, transportation, social sciences, and geographical databases. Twenty cross-sectional and 13 quasi-experimental studies published between 1996 and 2010 were included in the review.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Most associations between the built environment and physical activity were in the expected direction or null. Land use mix, connectivity and population density and overall neighborhood design were however, important determinants of physical activity. The built environment was more likely to be associated with transportation walking compared with other types of physical activity including recreational walking. Three studies found an attenuation in associations between built environment characteristics and physical activity after accounting for neighborhood self-selection.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: More quasi-experiments that examine a broader range of environmental attributes in relation to context-specific physical activity and that measure changes in the built environment, neighborhood preferences and their effect on physical activity are needed.},

abstract = {Background: Many youth fail to meet the recommended guidelines for physical activity. Walking and cycling, forms of active travel, have the potential to contribute significantly towards overall physical activity levels. Recent research examining the associations between physical activity and the environment has shown that environmental factors play a role in determining behaviour in children and adolescents. However, links between the environment and active travel have received less attention. Methods: Twenty four studies were identified which examined the associations between the environment (perceived or objectively measured) and active travel among youth aged 5–18 years. Findings were categorised according to the location of the environmental measure examined; attributes of the neighbourhood, destination and the route between home and destination. Results: Results from the reviewed studies indicated that youth active travel is positively associated with social interactions, facilities to assist active travel and urban form in the neighbourhood as well as shorter route length and road safety en-route. A conceptual framework is presented which highlights the associations between active travel behaviours and environmental factors, drawing upon both existing and hypothesised relationships. Conclusion: We provide a review of the available literature and present a novel theoretical framework that integrates the environment into the wider decision making process around travel choices for children and adolescents. Further work should explore associations where gaps in understanding have been identified, and account for the main moderators of behaviour so hypothesised associations can be confirmed.},

abstract = {The usual procedure for developing linear models to predict any kind of target variable is to identify a subset of most important predictors and to estimate weights that provide the best possible solution for a given sample. The resulting "optimally" weighted linear composite is then used when predicting new data. This approach is useful in situations with large and reliable datasets and few predictor variables. However, a large body of analytical and empirical evidence since the 1970s shows that such optimal variable weights are of little, if any, value in situations with small and noisy datasets and a large number of predictor variables. In such situations, which are common for social science problems, including all relevant variables is more important than their weighting. These findings have yet to impact many fields. This study uses data from nine U.S. election-forecasting models whose vote-share forecasts are regularly published in academic journals to demonstrate the value of (a) weighting all predictors equally and (b) including all relevant variables in the model. Across the ten elections from 1976 to 2012, equally weighted predictors yielded a lower forecast error than regression weights for six of the nine models. On average, the error of the equal-weights models was 5{\%} lower than the error of the original regression models. An equal-weights model that uses all 27 variables that are included in the nine models missed the final vote-share results of the ten elections on average by only 1.3 percentage points. This error is 48{\%} lower than the error of the typical, and 29{\%} lower than the error of the most accurate, regression model.},

And how did Google searches predict the spread of the H1N1 flu outbreak? The key to answering these questions, and many more, is big data. “Big data” refers to our burgeoning ability to crunch vast collections of information, analyze it instantly, and draw sometimes profoundly surprising conclusions from it. This emerging science can translate myriad phenomena—from the price of airline tickets to the text of millions of books—into searchable form, and uses our increasing computing power to unearth epiphanies that we never could have seen before. A revolution on par with the Internet or perhaps even the printing press, big data will change the way we think about business, health, politics, education, and innovation in the years to come. It also poses fresh threats, from the inevitable end of privacy as we know it to the prospect of being penalized for things we haven't even done yet, based on big data's ability to predict our future behavior. In this brilliantly clear, often surprising work, two leading experts explain what big data is, how it will change our lives, and what we can do to protect ourselves from its hazards.

Although cycling is an option for many commuters, a considerable number of them choose to use other forms of transport. In order to underpin policies that promote commuting by bicycle, this paper investigates the determinants for commuting to work. As many bicycle commuters do not cycle every day, we also examine people's daily choices, in terms of frequency. We conducted a survey of the current literature in order to identify the determinants for commuting by bicycle. We found many determinants, not all of which are addressed by conventional mode choice studies and models. This suggests that predicting and influencing bicycle use needs to be grounded in other kinds of knowledge than those currently available for motorized forms of transport.},

This does not, however, mean that the only alternative is to appeal to the mass market. The intermediate solution is to understand which groups of tourists have similar needs and develop tourism products that match group needs. This approach is referred to as market segmentation. The aim of this chapter is to analyze market segmentation studies in tourism research over the past decade, review recent prototypical examples of different segmentation approaches and discuss theoretical and methodological issues related to market segmentation studies.

abstract = {London's internationally acclaimed " cycling revolution " was characterised by an unprecedented investment in cycling infrastructure, particularly cycle lanes manifesting as Cycle Superhighways or Quietways. Despite the hegemony of cycle lanes in London's overarching cycling paradigm, the London Borough of Hackney has historically achieved the city's highest rates of cycling and a long-standing reputation as a cycling borough in the absence of cycle lanes. Instead, Hackney has always opted for spatial interventions (such as filtered permeability, a borough-wide 20 mph speed restriction, and speed humps). This paper challenges Hackney's reputation as a cycling borough and the alleged success of its spatial interventions. I argue that Hackney's privileging of spatial fixes treats spatial interventions as apolitical and value-neutral, which ignores inequities entrenched in cycling. I also argue that Hackney has taken for granted its high rates of cycling, therefore effectively adopting a cycle-blind (akin to race-blind) and cycle mainstreaming (akin to gender mainstreaming) approach to cycling policy and interventions. Consequently, Hackney's spatial interventions for cycling raise the profile of already-visible privileged cyclists (white, middle-class men – the middle-aged men in Lycra, or MAMILs, and the hipsters) for whom cycling is a lifestyle choice while further erasing " invisible cyclists " for whom cycling is an economic necessity. In order to be a relevant and sustainable mode of transportation for Hackney residents, equity and social justice must foreground the borough's approach to cycling.},

abstract = {A new narrative of accessibility has been incorporated into policy discourses in Great Britain. The paper's aim is to contribute to the welcome debate in transport geography which concerns itself with accessibility and its potential relation with wider discourses, particularly those of sustainability, globalisation and new mobilities. The paper offers thoughts on the extent to which accessibility may have a role in this debate. It is argued that a fuller conceptualisation of accessibility has the potential to achieve fuller understandings of accessibility-based policy goals and their implications, as well as informing the design of instruments to achieve policy delivery. To this end, notions of 'universal' and 'relative' rights are summarised and discussed in the accessibility context. A simple notional system is proposed through which the roles in accessibility of these two 'types' of rights may be recognised and understood. It is also proposed that a concept of 'strong' and 'weak' accessibility, paralleling similar ideas of sustainability, can be of value in the design of policy aimed at achieving greater accessibility and hence social inclusion and social dimensions of sustainability. The potential for a fruitful conceptual interaction between an accessibility narrative and discourses of globalisation and new mobilities is explored with a view to stimulating debate. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Regular physical activity such as biking can help prevent obesity and chronic disease. Improvements in cycling infrastructure are associated with higher overall cycling rates, but less is known about bike lane utilization in low-income urban neighborhoods. METHODS: During the summer of 2009, 4 Central Brooklyn streets with bicycle lanes were studied using camcorders to record for a total of 40 hours. Video recordings were coded for behaviors and characteristics of cyclists and motorists. An intercept survey (N = 324, 42{\%} participation rate) captured information on cyclist demographics, behaviors, and attitudes. RESULTS: 1282 cyclists were observed on study streets. Cyclists were primarily male (80.0{\%}) and non-White (54.5{\%}). 9.9{\%} of motorists drove in the bike lane and parked vehicles blocked the bike lane for 9.6{\%} of the observational period. Of cyclists surveyed, 69.4{\%} lived locally, 61.3{\%} were normal weight or underweight, and 64.8{\%} met recommended levels of physical activity by cycling 30+ minutes/day on 5+ days of the past week. CONCLUSIONS: Bicycle lanes were used by local residents of a low-income urban neighborhood. Compared with neighborhood residents overall, cyclists reported better health and health behaviors. Enhancing infrastructure that supports active transportation may be effective in reducing health inequities in low-income urban communities.},

abstract = {The substantial health-enhancing potential of physical activity can be realised on population level best if people can incorporate physical activity into their daily life routines. Physically active commuting to and from work provides a promising mode for such activity. In a series of three studies we explored more specifically the population prevalence, the physiological effectiveness, and the promotional possibilities of commuting to work by walking and cycling in a mid-size Finnish town. The results of the questionnaire survey indicated that while about one-third of the working-age sample commuted by walking or cycling an additional one-quarter were in a position to either begin or increase physically active commuting. The controlled intervention study showed that this kind of moderate-intensity, high-frequency activity improved the health-related fitness and selected indices of metabolic health. The promotion project in a large industrial plant demonstrated that walking and cycling during work trips can be successfully promoted by relatively low cost measures. These experiences suggest that physically active commuting to work offers substantial potential as a health-enhancing measure for working-age population.},

abstract = {potential for profit increase through more targeted marketing activities with a higher effect on market demand within the targeted segment (Kotler 1997). The burden of responsibility on researchers to identify the optimal segments is different for segmentation studies of different nature. In the case of a priori (Mazanec 2000) or commonsense segmentation (Dolnicar 2004) and extensions thereof (concepts 1, 3, 4, and 5 according to the classifica-tion of segmentation studies proposed by Dolnicar 2004) the crucial decision is the selection of the segmentation criterion or criteria. For instance, a destination might choose to target young tourists using age as the commonsense criterion. On closer evaluation, however, it might turn out that using the stage in the family life cycle would have been a better choice, as the destination's strength lies in providing optimal services to young families, rather than young singles or groups of young tourists. In the case of post-hoc (Myers and Tauber 1977), a poste-riori (Mazanec 2000), or data-driven segmentation (Dolnicar 2004) and extensions thereof (segmentation concepts 2, 4, 5, and 6), this burden of responsibility lies on the research approach of the data-driven segmentation study undertaken. Because the process of data-driven segmentation consists of numerous components, most of them requiring a decision on the part of the researcher, it is more difficult to avoid potential misinterpretations or suboptimal procedural decisions than in the case of a priori segmentation studies. The present study investigates one particular aspect of the data-driven segmentation process: the way the original answers of respondents are used to derive market segments. The concept of market segmentation has been widely accepted and warmly embraced both by tourism industry and academia. In tourism research, this increased interest in segmentation studies has led to the emergence of a standard research approach. Most notably a concept referred to as " factor–cluster segmentation " has been broadly adopted. The aim of this article is to demonstrate that this approach is not generally the best procedure to identify homogeneous groups of individuals (market segments).},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To assess the effects of interventions to promote walking in individuals and populations. DESIGN Systematic review. DATA SOURCES Published and unpublished reports in any language identified by searching 25 electronic databases, by searching websites, reference lists, and existing systematic reviews, and by contacting experts. REVIEW METHODS Systematic search for and appraisal of controlled before and after studies of the effects of any type of intervention on how much people walk, the distribution of effects on walking between social groups, and any associated effects on overall physical activity, fitness, risk factors for disease, health, and wellbeing. RESULTS We included 19 randomised controlled trials and 29 non-randomised controlled studies. Interventions tailored to people's needs, targeted at the most sedentary or at those most motivated to change, and delivered either at the level of the individual (brief advice, supported use of pedometers, telecommunications) or household (individualised marketing) or through groups, can encourage people to walk more, although the sustainability, generalisability, and clinical benefits of many of these approaches are uncertain. Evidence for the effectiveness of interventions applied to workplaces, schools, communities, or areas typically depends on isolated studies or subgroup analysis. CONCLUSIONS The most successful interventions could increase walking among targeted participants by up to 30-60 minutes a week on average, at least in the short term. From a perspective of improving population health, much of the research currently provides evidence of efficacy rather than effectiveness. Nevertheless, interventions to promote walking could contribute substantially towards increasing the activity levels of the most sedentary.},

abstract = {AbstractResearch linking bikeway infrastructure and cycling levels has increased significantly over the last 20 years — with the strongest growth since 2010. The research has evolved from the study of lanes and paths, to include analyses of the role of intersection treatments, and finally to studies that attempt to measure the whole bike network. Most studies suggest a positive relationship between bikeway networks or aspects of the network and cycling levels. Stated and revealed-preference studies suggest a hierarchy of cyclist and non-cyclist preferences may exist, favoring separate paths and/or lanes over cycling on roadways with traffic — particularly with high volumes of fast-moving motorized traffic. Revealed- and stated-route-choice studies indicate that intersections have negative effects on the cycling experience, but that certain features can offset this. The research correlating link and node characteristics to cycling implies that networks of such facilities would have positive effects, though...},

abstract = {Objective: Cycling confers individual and population-level health benefits, but uptake is not always equitable across socio-demographic groups. We sought to examine inequalities in uptake and usage of London's Barclays Cycle Hire (BCH) scheme. Method: We obtained complete BCH registration data, and compared users with the general population. We examined usage levels by explanatory variables including gender, small-area income-deprivation and local cycling prevalence. Results: 100,801 registered individuals made 2.5 million trips between July 2010 and March 2011. Compared with residents and workers in the central London area served by the scheme, registered individuals were more likely to be male and to live in areas of low deprivation and high cycling prevalence. Among those registered, females made 1.63 (95{\%}CI 1.53, 1.74) fewer trips per month than males, and made under a fifth of all trips. Adjusting for the fact that deprived areas were less likely to be close to BCH docking stations, users in the most deprived areas made 0.85 (95{\%}CI 0.63,1.07) more trips per month than those in the least deprived areas. Conclusion: Females and residents in deprived areas are underrepresented among users of London's public bicycle sharing scheme. The scheme's planned expansion into more deprived areas has, however, the potential to create a more equitable uptake of cycling. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc..},

The authors find that whereas road facility designs, like street density, connectivity, and proximity to Ciclovi짯a lanes, are associated with physical activity, other attributes of the built environment, like density and land-use mixtures, are not. This is likely because most neighborhoods in built-up sections of Bogota evolved during a time when non-automobile travel reigned supreme, meaning they are uniformly compact, mixed in their land-use composition, and have comparable levels of transport accessibility. Thus facility designs are what sway nonmotorized travel, not generic land-use attributes of neighborhoods.},

abstract = {This article examines the extent to which protected infrastructure is associated with greater diversity and normalisation of cycling. In the UK, cyclists are predominantly male and often wear distinctive cycle clothing rather than everyday clothes. This is not the case in higher-cycling countries such as the Netherlands and Germany. It has been argued that the UK's demographic skewing may be partly due to poor quality infrastructure which can be off-putting for many, but particularly for women, children and older people. Route choice studies tend to confirm that women are more likely than men to choose routes with greater levels of separation from motor traffic. Other work suggests that if cycling feels unsafe, cyclists may wear specialised cycle clothing such as helmets, which then may itself support a perception of cycling as dangerous. This small-scale exploratory study examines age, gender, and use of specialist clothing in relation to infrastructure type, comparing a recently improved route with separate space for cyclists to parallel busy streets without protected cycle infrastructure. The separated route showed better, though still unequal, demographic balance and a reduced tendency for cyclists to wear helmets and sporty clothing, though not high-visibility items. Infrastructure type is only one factor in route choice, particularly if there is relatively little good infrastructure along key desire lines. However this paper suggests that infrastructure for cycling could help to improve perceptions of safety and the need to wear specialist cycle clothing. In turn this could promote a better demographic balance and normalise cycling.},

abstract = {A considerable body of literature has investigated how environmental exposures affect health through various pathways. These studies have generally adopted a common approach to define environmental exposures, focusing on the local residential environment, using census tracts or postcodes to delimit exposures. However, use of such administrative units may not be appropriate to evaluate contextual effets on health because they are generally not a 'true' representation of the environments to which individuals are exposed. Recent work has suggested that advances may be made if an activity-space approach is adopted. The present paper investigates how various disciplines may contribute to the refinement of the concept of activity space for use in health research. In particular we draw on seminal work in time geography, which provides a framework to describe individual behavior in space and time, and can help the conceptualization of activity space. In addition we review work in environmental psychology and social networks research, which provides insights on how people and places interact and offers new theories for improving the spatial definition of contextual exposures. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The focus for interventions and research on physical activity has moved away from vigorous activity to moderate-intensity activities, such as walking. In addition, a social ecological approach to physical activity research and practice is recommended. This approach considers the influence of the environment and policies on physical activity. Although there is limited empirical published evidence related to the features of the physical environment that influence physical activity, urban planning and transport agencies have developed policies and strategies that have the potential to influence whether people walk or cycle in their neighbourhood. This paper presents the development of a framework of the potential environmental influences on walking and cycling based on published evidence and policy literature, interviews with experts and a Delphi study. The framework includes four features: functional, safety, aesthetic and destination; as well as the hypothesised factors that contribute to each of these features of the environment. In addition, the Delphi experts determined the perceived relative importance of these factors. Based on these factors, a data collection tool will be developed and the frameworks will be tested through the collection of environmental information on neighbourhoods, where data on the walking and cycling patterns have been collected previously. Identifying the environmental factors that influence walking and cycling will allow the inclusion of a public health perspective as well as those of urban planning and transport in the design of built environments.},

Immobility, activity engagement and physical activity were explored in relation with age, gender and walkability of the built environment. Number of trips per day and minutes spent on walking by the elderly were extracted from a broad travel survey with more than 12,000 CATI interviews and were compared across vital and non-vital urban environments. Results highlight the importance of vital environments for elderly active mobility as subpopulations residing in highly walkable neighbourhoods undertook more trips and spent more minutes walking than their counterparts. The results also suggest that the built environment has different effects in terms of gender, as elderly men were more susceptible to urban vitality than elderly women.},

abstract = {The daily trip to work is ubiquitous, yet its characteristics differ widely from person to person and place to place. This is manifested in statistics on mode and distance of travel, which vary depending on a range of factors that operate at different scales. This heterogeneity is problematic for decision makers tasked with encouraging more sustainable commuter patterns. Numerical models, based on real commuting data, have great potential to aid the decision making process. However, we contend that new approaches are needed to advance knowledge about the social and geographical factors that relate to the diversity of commuter patterns, if policies targeted to specific individuals or places are to be effective. To this end, the paper presents a spatial microsimulation approach, which combines individual-level survey data with geographically aggregated census results to tackle the problem. This method overcomes the limitations imposed by the lack of available geocoded micro-data. Further, it allows a range of scales of analysis to be pursued in parallel and provides insights into both the types of area and individual that would benefit most from specific interventions. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {In low-cycling countries, cycling is not evenly distributed across genders and age groups. In the UK, men are twice as likely as women to cycle to work and cycling tends to be dominated by younger adults. By contrast, in higher cycling countries and cities, gender differences are low, absent, or in the opposite direction. Such places also lack the UK's steady decline in cycling among those aged over 35 years. Over the past fifteen years some UK local areas have seen increases in cycling. This paper analyses data from the English and Welsh Census 2001 and 2011 to examine whether such increases are associated with greater diversity among cyclists. We find that in areas where cycling has increased, there has been no increase in the representation of females, and a decrease in the representation of older adults. We discuss potential causes and policy implications. Importantly, simply increasing cycling modal share has not proved sufficient to create an inclusive cycling culture. The UK's culturally specific factors limiting female take-up of cycling seem to remain in place, even where cycling has gone up. Creating a mass cycling culture may require deliberately targeting infrastructure and policies towards currently under-represented groups.},

Data from a qualitative sociological study is used here to explore the difference that cultural meanings make to cycling practices in four different English urban areas. Specifically, we discuss differences between places with established cycling cultures and those with newer cycling cultures. Drawing on concepts from practice theory we discuss the role that cultures of cycling play within the four places, and suggest how the meanings of cycling, including its association with other social identities, are connected to the materials and competences seen as necessary for cycling. Our research highlights the embedding of transport in local as well as national cultures, and the associated need for policy-makers to take culture seriously in considering how to shift transport practices. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Perceived environmental barriers to walking to school are measured and compared for fifth graders (n = 193) and their parents (n = 177). Results showed that children and parents often agreed on walking barriers, except an interaction showed that - in the less walkable community - parents perceived worse barriers than did their children. Perceptions of barriers increased from walkable, to mixed, to less walkable communities. Students walked more when they attended the school in the walkable community, they lived near school, parents and children perceived fewer barriers to walking, and children had lower BMI scores, net of demographic controls. Thus the walk to school is embedded within multiple types of supports, all of which should be addressed to encourage walking to school. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

This research assesses the geographic distribution of cycling infrastructure with regard to community demographic characteristics to assess claims that cycling investment arrives in tandem with incoming populations of privilege or is targeted towards neighborhoods with existing socioeconomic wealth. Using census and municipal cycling infrastructure data in Chicago and Portland from 1990 to 2010, we create demographic and cycling infrastructure investment indices at the census tract level. Linear regressions estimate the extent to which existing community demographics and change in demographics associated with gentrification are related to cycling infrastructure investment. In both cities, we identify a bias towards increased cycling infrastructure investment in areas of existing or increasing privilege. This paper suggests that marginalized communities are unlikely to attract as much cycling infrastructure investment without the presence of privileged populations, even when considering population density and distance to downtown, two motivators of urban cycling. To alleviate the continuation of inequitable distributions of cycling investments, planning processes may actively seek out diverse stakeholders and be sensitive to citywide community input and stated needs in future transportation projects.},

abstract = {CONTEXT Environmental factors are suggested to play a major role in physical activity (PA) and other obesity-related behaviors, yet there is no national research on the relationship between disparity in access to recreational facilities and additional impact on PA and overweight patterns in US adolescents. OBJECTIVE In a nationally representative cohort, we sought to assess the geographic and social distribution of PA facilities and how disparity in access might underlie population-level PA and overweight patterns. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Residential locations of US adolescents in wave I (1994-1995) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N = 20745) were geocoded, and a 8.05-km buffer around each residence was drawn (N = 42857 census-block groups [19{\%} of US block groups]). PA facilities, measured by national databases and satellite data, were linked with Geographic Information Systems technology to each respondent. Logistic-regression analyses tested the relationship of PA-related facilities with block-group socioeconomic status (SES) (at the community level) and the subsequent association of facilities with overweight and PA (at the individual level), controlling for population density. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Outcome measures were overweight (BMI {\textgreater} or = 95th percentile of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/National Center for Health Statistics growth curves) and achievement of {\textgreater} or = 5 bouts per week of moderate-vigorous PA. RESULTS Higher-SES block groups had a significantly greater relative odds of having 1 or more facilities. Low-SES and high-minority block groups were less likely to have facilities. Relative to zero facilities per block group, an increasing number of facilities was associated with decreased overweight and increased relative odds of achieving {\textgreater} or = 5 bouts per week of moderate-vigorous PA. CONCLUSIONS Lower-SES and high-minority block groups had reduced access to facilities, which in turn was associated with decreased PA and increased overweight. Inequality in availability of PA facilities may contribute to ethnic and SES disparities in PA and overweight patterns.},

And how did Google searches predict the spread of the H1N1 flu outbreak? The key to answering these questions, and many more, is big data. “Big data” refers to our burgeoning ability to crunch vast collections of information, analyze it instantly, and draw sometimes profoundly surprising conclusions from it. This emerging science can translate myriad phenomena—from the price of airline tickets to the text of millions of books—into searchable form, and uses our increasing computing power to unearth epiphanies that we never could have seen before. A revolution on par with the Internet or perhaps even the printing press, big data will change the way we think about business, health, politics, education, and innovation in the years to come. It also poses fresh threats, from the inevitable end of privacy as we know it to the prospect of being penalized for things we haven't even done yet, based on big data's ability to predict our future behavior. In this brilliantly clear, often surprising work, two leading experts explain what big data is, how it will change our lives, and what we can do to protect ourselves from its hazards.

abstract = {Introduction Social and self-identities have been conceptualised to prevent travel behaviour change, as threats to one's identity may cause resistance to change. This study focuses on the role of social, transport, place, and self-identities on commute mode choice and intention to change mode choice. Method Data were collected in June 2015 in Utrecht, the Netherlands. Invitations to participate were distributed by mail using data from the municipality, resulting in 1062 adult participants. The outcome measures were the transport mode shares based on a 14-day travel-to-and-from-work record of trips (i) involving any car use, (ii) involving any bicycling, (iii) involving any walking, and (iv) involving any public transport use. The second series of outcome measures concerned the willingness to change the amount of car use, bicycle use and walking, determined by the question ‘to what extent do you intend to change the use of {\ldots}?'. Identity was measured on a seven-point disagree/agree scale for 17 items by asking to what extent the respondent ‘sees him/herself as {\ldots}'. Separate multinomial regression models were estimated stepwise adjusting for socioeconomic and transport characteristics. Results Multiple identity items were associated with the use of all commute modes. In the maximally adjusted models, identities associated with the respective modes remained significant. For example, whether someone identified themselves with being a cyclist corresponded with higher likelihood of cycling occasionally (relative risk ratio (RRR): 1.84; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI):1.47–2.30), or always to work (RRR: 2.86; 95{\%} CI: 2.16–3.79). In addition, we found that a family-oriented identity was negatively associated with occasional commuting by car, and a ‘sporty' identity was negatively associated with always cycling to work. Transport identities were also associated with stated intentions to change as were several social, place, and self-identities. Identifying with being a car driver decreased the likelihood of intending to reduce car use, but it increased the likelihood of intending to increase car use, as did identifying with being career-oriented. Individuals that identified with being a cyclist were less likely to have an intention to reduce bicycle use, whereas countryside-lovers had greater intentions of increasing cycling. Individuals that identified themselves as pedestrians had a lower intention of decreasing their walking levels, and a higher intention of increasing them, as did those who identified themselves as being family-oriented. Discussion The results confirm limited previous findings that identifying with users of a transport mode correspond with its use. Nevertheless, questions around causality remain. The intention to change mode choice was associated with several identities, including transport-related identities, place-related identities, social/family-related identities, and self-identities. Future research should focus on the associations between identity and actual behaviour change to further our understanding of the effect of identity on travel behaviour.},

abstract = {A review of accessibility measures is presented for assessing the usability of these measures in evaluations of land-use and transport strategies and developments. Accessibility measures are reviewed using a broad range of relevant criteria, including theoretical basis, interpretability and communicability, and data requirements of the measures. Accessibility impacts of land-use and transport strategies are often evaluated using accessibility measures, which researchers and policy makers can easily operationalise and interpret, such as travelling speed, but which generally do not satisfy theoretical criteria. More complex and disaggregated accessibility measures, however, increase complexity and the effort for calculations and the difficulty of interpretation. The current practice can be much improved by operationalising more advanced location-based and utility-based accessibility measures that are still relatively easy to interpret for researchers and policy makers, and can be computed with state-of-the-practice data and/or land-use and transport models. Research directions towards theoretically more advanced accessibility measures point towards the inclusion of individual's spatial-temporal constraints and feedback mechanisms between accessibility, land-use and travel behaviour. Furthermore, there is a need for theoretical and empirical research on relationships between accessibility, option values and non-user benefits, and the measurement of different components of accessibility. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A reduction in the energy intensity of private transport is the least cost-feasible approach to mitigate the uncertainties of future oil supplies, given the impending peak in world conventional oil production. The built environment and transport infrastructure of an urban form determine the extent to which low-impact adaptations to these constraints are possible and hence the resilience of residents to fuel price shocks and constraints. This paper introduces the concept of active mode accessibility (AMA), defined as the proportion of activities that can be reached by active modes alone, given the population demographics of the study area. AMA is characterized by the underlying geographic form of an urban area and its transport networks. High AMA means that the resident transport activity system can be served with minimal energy input; consequently resilience to fuel shocks and constraints is greater. The AMA method is based on accessibility analysis and extends the depth of the analysis with energy-based activity modeling and defines a measure of energy accessibility. The paper introduces a spatial method for calculating the AMA within a selected study area and a geographic information system-based tool for applying the method, and presents two case studies. Central Christchurch, New Zealand, gives an AMA of 100{\%} because the city has a high density of destinations and a wide range of local facilities available for every activity. The satellite township of Rolleston gives a significantly lower AMA of 59{\%}, principally because of a lack of local preschool and high school facilities and an insufficient diversity of destinations for some activities.},

abstract = {This article analyzes the variation in bike commuting in large American cities, with a focus on assessing the influence of bike paths and lanes, which have been the main approach to increasing cycling in the USA. To examine the role of cycling facilities, we used a newly assembled dataset on the length of bike lanes and paths in 2008 collected directly from 90 of the 100 largest U.S. cities. Pearson's correlation, bivariate quartile analysis, and two different types of regressions were used to measure the relationship between cycling levels and bikeways, as well as other explanatory and control variables. Ordinary Least Squares and Binary Logit Proportions regressions confirm that cities with a greater supply of bike paths and lanes have significantly higher bike commute rates—even when controlling for land use, climate, socioeconomic factors, gasoline prices, public transport supply, and cycling safety. Standard tests indicate that the models are a good fit, with R 2 ranging between 0.60 and 0.65. Computed coefficients have the expected signs for all variables in the various regression models, but not all are statistically significant. Estimated elasticities indicate that both off-street paths and on-street lanes have a similar positive association with bike commute rates in U.S. cities. Our results are consistent with previous research on the importance of separate cycling facilities and provide additional information about the potentially different role of paths vs. lanes. Our analysis also revealed that cities with safer cycling, lower auto ownership, more students, less sprawl, and higher gasoline prices had more cycling to work. By comparison, annual precipitation, the number of cold and hot days, and public transport supply were not statistically significant predictors of bike commuting in large cities.},

abstract = {The labeling and the categorizing of cyclists have been occurring for more than a century for a variety of purposes. This study examined a typology developed by the City of Portland, Oregon, that included four categories of cyclists: “the strong and the fearless,” “the enthused and confident,” “the interested but concerned,” and “no way, no how.” Unlike several other typologies, this widely referenced typology was intended to apply to all adults, regardless of their current cycling behavior. An analysis was conducted with data from a random phone survey (n 5 908) of adults in the Portland region. Adults were placed into one of the four categories primarily on the basis of their stated comfort level with cycling on a variety of facility types, their interest in cycling as transportation, and their physical ability to bicycle. Nearly all of the sampled population fit clearly into one of the four categories. A majority (56{\%}) of the region's population fit in the interested but concerned category, which was thought to be the key target market to increase the use of cycling as a form of transportation. The analysis indicated that a reduction in traffic speed and an increase in the separation between bicycles and motor vehicles (e.g., cycle tracks) might increase levels of comfort and cycling rates. Women and older adults were underrepresented among the more confident adults and those who currently cycled for transportation.},

Market research firms spend sizeable amounts of thought, time, and money refining their recruiting efforts. They know if they don't deliver enough of the right people for a focus group, their reputation in the business world suffers. They know the art of recruiting. In contrast, public sector organizations tend to underestimate the importance and difficulty of recruiting participants. Public and nonprofit organizations operate within a different environment. Most can't spend huge amounts of money on recruit-ing. They operate under different traditions, constraints, rules and procedures. Not-for-Profit Organizations Often Have Difficulty Recruiting Nonprofit and public organizations that do their own focus group recruiting often have difficulty, because they assume focus group participants are like volunteers. However, volunteers are typically more aware of and committed to the organization's mission than are others. Yet, these organizations often need to recruit people who aren't already committed to the issue and who have other interests and responsibilities competing for their time. Organizations underestimate how difficult it is to get participants to agree to attend, and they overestimate the likelihood that those who agree to attend will actually show up at the appointed time.},

abstract = {Conventional transportation planning is often focused on improving movement (or mobility)--most often by the automobile. To the extent that accessibility, a well-known concept in the transportation planning field since the 1950s, has been measured or used in transportation planning, such measures have also been auto-based. Broadening the scope of accessibility to include a wide array of destinations and non-auto modes such as walking, cycling, and transit has been previously proposed as a much needed aim among planning initiatives. A central issue is that to date, however, there have been few examples of measures draw from. When it comes to bicycling, walking, and transit measures of accessibility are an endeavor long on rhetoric but short on execution.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThis report discusses such hurdles, presents alternatives for overcoming them, and demonstrates how accessibility for walking, cycling, and transit--and for different types of destinations--can be reliably measured. We focus on explaining specific features of non-motorized transportation that complicate the development of accessibility measures, and offer solutions that conform to conventional transportation planning practice. In this research project, non-motorized measures of accessibility were developed for the entire seven counties of the Twin Cities (Minnesota, USA) metropolitan area. For purposes of this exposition in this report, we discuss the details of creating such measures using a sample application from Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA to demonstrate proof of concept for the endeavor.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: Electrically assisted bicycles (EAB) are an emerging transportation modality favored for environmental reasons. Some physical effort is required to activate the supporting engine, making it a potential active commuting option. PURPOSE: We hypothesized that using an EAB in a hilly city allows sedentary subjects to commute comfortably, while providing a sufficient effort for health-enhancing purposes. METHODS: Sedentary subjects performed four different trips at a self-selected pace: walking 1.7 km uphill from the train station to the hospital (WALK), biking 5.1 km from the lower part of town to the hospital with a regular bike (BIKE), or EAB at two different power assistance settings (EAB high, EAB std). HR, oxygen consumption, and need to shower were recorded. RESULTS: Eighteen sedentary subjects (12 female, 6 male) age 36 ± 10 yr were included, with V{\textperiodcentered}O 2max of 39.4 ± 5.4 mL{\textperiodcentered}min(-1){\textperiodcentered}kg(-1). Time to complete the course was 22 (WALK), 19 (EAB high), 21 (EAB std), and 30 (BIKE) min. Mean {\%}V{\textperiodcentered}O 2max was 59.0{\%}, 54.9{\%}, 65.7{\%}, and 72.8{\%}. Mean {\%}HRmax was 71.5{\%}, 74.5{\%}, 80.3{\%}, and 84.0{\%}. There was no significant difference between WALK and EAB high, but all other comparisons were different (P {\textless} 0.05). Two subjects needed to shower after EAB high, 3 needed to shower after WALK, 8 needed to shower after EAB std, and all 18 needed to shower after BIKE. WALK and EAB high elicited 6.5 and 6.1 METs (no difference), whereas it was 7.3 and 8.2 for EAB std and BIKE. CONCLUSIONS: EAB is a comfortable and ecological transportation modality, helping sedentary people commute to work and meet physical activity guidelines. Subjects appreciated ease of use and mild effort needed to activate the engine support climbing hills, without the need to shower at work. EAB can be promoted in a challenging urban environment to promote physical activity and mitigate pollution issues.},

abstract = {Much of the literature on social exclusion ignores its ‘spatial' or ‘mobility' related aspects. This paper seeks to rectify this by examining the mobile processes and infrastructures of travel and transport that engender and reinforce social exclusion in$\backslash$r$\backslash$ncontemporary societies. To the extent to which this issue is addressed, it is mainly organized around the notion of ‘access' to activities, values and goods. This paper examines this discourse in some detail. It is argued that there are many dimensions of such access, that improving access is a complex matter because of the range of human activities that might need to be ‘accessed', that in order to know what is to be accessed the changing nature of travel and communications requires examination, and that some dimensions of access are only revealed through changes in the$\backslash$r$\backslash$ninfrastructure that ‘uncover' previously hidden social exclusions. Claims about access and socio-spatial exclusion routinely make assumptions about what it is to participate effectively in society. We turn this question around, also asking how mobilities of different forms constitute societal values and sets of relations, participation in which may become important for social inclusion. This paper draws upon an extensive range of library, desk and field research to deal with crucial issues relating to the nature of a fair, just and mobile society.},

It is commonplace for social science research to adopt a policy of ‘blanket anonymisation', whereby all names, places and other identifying features are disguised across a data set, including from interview transcripts, diaries and field notes. Here, I consider the practical and theoretical implications of such a strategy and suggest that anonymisation is not a process to be conducted – and assumed completed – at just one stage of the research process. Moreover, anonymisation strategies cannot be separated out from other methodological (such as issues around archiving or mixing methods) or indeed substantive issues (such as enabling deeper appreciation of the relationality of networks, or the ways in which space might be constructed). The implications of whatever anonymisation strategy researchers adopt on the future ability to appreciate the social and spatial processes behind networks, neighbourhoods and communities, need to be made clear throughout the research process.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Empirical evidence suggests that an association between the built environment and physical activity exists. This evidence is mostly derived from cross-sectional studies that do not account for other causal explanations such as neighborhood self-selection. Experimental and quasi-experimental designs can be used to isolate the effect of the built environment on physical activity, but in their absence, statistical techniques that adjust for neighborhood self-selection can be used with cross-sectional data. Previous reviews examining the built environment-physical activity relationship have not differentiated among findings based on study design. To deal with self-selection, we synthesized evidence regarding the relationship between objective measures of the built environment and physical activity by including in our review: 1) cross-sectional studies that adjust for neighborhood self-selection and 2) quasi-experiments.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHOD: In September 2010, we searched for English-language studies on built environments and physical activity from all available years in health, leisure, transportation, social sciences, and geographical databases. Twenty cross-sectional and 13 quasi-experimental studies published between 1996 and 2010 were included in the review.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Most associations between the built environment and physical activity were in the expected direction or null. Land use mix, connectivity and population density and overall neighborhood design were however, important determinants of physical activity. The built environment was more likely to be associated with transportation walking compared with other types of physical activity including recreational walking. Three studies found an attenuation in associations between built environment characteristics and physical activity after accounting for neighborhood self-selection.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: More quasi-experiments that examine a broader range of environmental attributes in relation to context-specific physical activity and that measure changes in the built environment, neighborhood preferences and their effect on physical activity are needed.},

abstract = {There is a lack of tools to identify and measure community severance caused by large roads and motorised traffic, despite the evidence of its negative impacts on local communities. This paper reports the development of a suite of tools to measure and value community severance, undertaken as a part of the Street Mobility and Network Accessibility research project. The tools include participatory mapping, spatial analysis, a video survey, street audits, a health and neighbourhood mobility survey, and a valuation tool based on a stated preference survey. They were tested in the area around Finchley Road, a busy arterial road in North London. The study found that Finchley Road is an unpleasant place for pedestrians due to high traffic levels, air and noise pollution, and the lack and poor quality of pedestrian crossing facilities. This has a negative impact on the mobility and accessibility of local residents and, to some extent, on their health and wellbeing. The analysis showed coherence between the findings from the different measurement tools applied individually, but also revealed interconnections between factors which contribute to severance, demonstrating that overall the suite is reliable for assessing community severance in urban areas. Overall, the paper provides a multidisciplinary approach to developing standardised methods to measure a negative impact of transport that is still relatively unknown.},

The aim of this study was to determine the location of a range of resources and exposures by deprivation in a UK city. We examined the location of 42 resources in Glasgow City, Scotland, in 2005-2006, by quintile of small area deprivation. Measures included number per 1000 population, network distance to nearest resource, and percentage of data zones containing at least one of each type of resource. Twelve resources had higher density in, and/or were closer to or more common in, more deprived neighbourhoods: public nurseries, public primary schools, police stations, pharmacies, credit unions, post offices, bus stops, bingo halls, public swimming pools, public sports centres, outdoor play areas, and vacant and derelict land/buildings. Sixteen had higher density in, and/or were closer to, or more common in, more affluent neighbourhoods: public secondary schools, private schools, banks, building societies, museums/art galleries, railway stations, subway stations, tennis courts, bowling greens, private health clubs, private swimming pools, colleges, A {\&} E hospitals, parks, waste disposal sites, and tourist attractions. Private nurseries, Universities, fire stations, general, dental and ophthalmic practices, pawn brokers, ATMs, supermarkets, fast food chains, cafes, public libraries, golf courses, and cinemas showed no clear pattern by deprivation. Thus it appears that in the early 21st century access to resources does not always disadvantage poorer neighbourhoods in the UK. We conclude that we need to ensure that theories and policies are based on up-to-date and context-specific empirical evidence on the distribution of neighbourhood resources, and to engage in further research on interactions between individual and environmental factors in shaping health and health inequalities. {\textcopyright} 2008.},

abstract = {Climate change will create new stresses for populations across the globe. Whatever mitigation pathways are adopted the question is about how much, not whether, climatic change will impact on society. In particular, we can expect more extreme rainfall events, flooding and variations in temperature which our infrastructures were not designed to cope with. This paper poses fundamental questions about how societies should respond to this. In particular, through the use of existing frameworks of resilience and adaptive capacity the paper presents a comparative analysis of two potential response strategies. The first is a transport systems approach which focuses on the availability of infrastructures and transport services. The second is an activity systems approach which focuses on ability of society to conduct activities. The differences are explored conceptually and through a series of innovative data sets collected during periods of significant weather related disruption as part of the RCUK funded Disruption project. The paper concludes that a transport systems approach sits comfortably within existing institutional structures and accountability processes. Each element of the system seeks to minimize the extent to which it is a source of failure under climatic events. This results in an ultimately flawed investment strategy underpinned by a paradigm of perceived stability. Such an approach also marginalizes user preferences for other strategies. The activity systems approach by contrast broadens the toolbox of responses beyond the transport system and integrates personal and group action and capacities. The activity systems approach incorporates the transport system but does not privilege it. Adopting such an approach could radically alter the transport planning paradigm and is not restricted to planning for extreme climate scenarios.},

The construction of bicycle lane networks has been identified as an effective tool for increasing citizen's mobility and accessibility as well as combatting the effects of motorization, but in cities where bicycle lane networks exist, it is not known if they have benefitted different income groups equally. This paper assesses the extent to which bicycle lane provisioning has been equitable among neighbourhoods in Rio de Janeiro and Curitiba. Both cities were found to have more than twice the supply of bicycle lanes in the wealthiest quintile than the lowest-income quintile relative to area and population. A network analysis using a Level of Traffic Safety classification to categorize roads found that wealthier areas have more commercial areas accessible along safer cycling routes.

abstract = {Previous research on walking and cycling as primary modes of local access for local centres in metropolitan areas, have focused on the role of the street network, urban design quality, socio-economic characteristics and urban form as predisposing factors to walking and cycling. A neglected factor is that of terrain as an impedance to walking and cycling for access to a local centre. Whilst most suburban areas in large metropolitan areas tend to be in locations with minimal topographical variations, there are substantial portions of Australian cities that are hilly and have local streets with gradients that are steep enough to present a significant challenge to walking and cycling. This paper details the methodologies used and the results of a comparative analysis of two metropolitan Adelaide suburbs (Salisbury and Golden Grove) with public transit interchanges that service a predominantly residential neighbourhood precinct within their respective local catchments of approximately a 1.6km radius, to determine the impact of topography on local transport modal choice. Both Salisbury and Golden Grove are located approximately 22km from the centre of Adelaide city centre in Adelaide{\&}rsquo;s north-eastern suburbs and both have similar intensity of retailing activity and style and density of residential development. However, Golden Grove is extremely hilly with elevations varying by up to 90m up to 214m, whereas Salisbury is largely level at an elevation of approximately 35m. This paper concludes with transport and urban planning policy implications of considering the influence of topography on local modal transport choices in suburban centres.},

This paper reports on a large research project which uses a mixed method approach to explore attitudes to and perceptions of walking and cycling, and which examines the process of household decision-making for everyday travel and the constraints that this imposes. Using survey, interview and ethnographic data it is argued that many people hold ambiguous and sometimes contradictory views of walking and cycling as effective means of everyday travel, that what they do rarely matches precisely what they believe, and that the complexity and contingency associated with everyday travel for many households is a major barrier to the use of more sustainable travel modes. It is suggested that better understanding of these processes could help to inform both future transport policy and the promotion of walking and cycling for short trips in urban areas. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Drawing on concepts from practice theory we discuss the role that cultures of cycling play within the four places, and suggest how the meanings of cycling, including its association with other social identities, are connected to the materials and competences seen as necessary for cycling.

For each setting, we compared a business-as-usual 2030 projection (without policies for reduction of greenhouse gases) with alternative scenarios—lower-carbon-emission motor vehicles, increased active travel, and a combination of the two. We developed separate models that linked transport scenarios with physical activity, air pollution, and risk of road traffi c injury. In both cities, we noted that reduction in carbon dioxide emissions through an increase in active travel and less use of motor vehicles had larger health benefi ts per million population (7332 disability-adjusted life-years [DALYs] in London, and 12 516 in Delhi in 1 year) than from the increased use of lower-emission motor vehicles (160 DALYs in London, and 1696 in Delhi). However, combination of active travel and lower-emission motor vehicles would give the largest benefi ts (7439 DALYs in London, 12 995 in Delhi), notably from a reduction in the number of years of life lost from ischaemic heart disease (10–19{\%} in London, 11–25{\%} in Delhi).

Accessibility refers to people's ability to reach goods, services and activities, which is the ultimate goal of most transport activity. Many factors affect accessibility, including mobility (physical movement), the quality and affordability of transport options, transport system connectivity, mobility substitutes, and land use patterns. Accessibility can be evaluated from various perspectives, including a particular group, mode, location or activity. Conventional planning tends to overlook and undervalue some of these factors and perspectives. More comprehensive analysis of accessibility in planning expands the scope of potential solutions to transport problems.},

abstract = {Multimodality, the use of more than one mode of transportation during a specified time period, is gaining recognition as an important mechanism for reducing automobile dependence by shifting trips from automobiles to walking, cycling, or public transportation. Most prior research on multimodality focuses on Western European countries. Based on the 2001 and 2009 National Household Travel Surveys, this paper analyzes trends and determinants of multimodal car use in the U.S. during a typical week by distinguishing between (1) monomodal car users who drive or ride in a car for all trips, (2) multimodal car users who drive or ride in a car and also use non-automobile modes, and (3) individuals who exclusively walk, cycle, and/or ride public transportation. We find that during a typical week a majority—almost two thirds—of Americans use a car and make at least one trip by foot, bicycle, or public transportation. One in four Americans uses a car and makes at least seven weekly trips by other modes of transportation. Results from multinomial and logistic regression analyses suggest there may be a continuum of mobility types ranging from monomodal car users to walk, bicycle, and/or public transportation only users—with multimodal car users positioned in-between the two extremes. Policy changes aimed at curtailing car use may result in movements along this spectrum with increasing multimodality for car users.},

Although the rate of bike trips made in the USA has more than tripled since 1977, it is relatively low compared with many European cities (Pucher et al., 2011a). In urban areas throughout the USA, bicycling is increasingly being touted as an environmentally friendly way to enhance transit choice as public transportation budgets are slashed and automobile infrastructures remain congested. Discourse around the proliferation of bicycling infrastructure development in American cities often obscures complex aspects of community-level choice regarding transit, including the placement and implementation of bike lanes. This paper seeks to explore the dynamic ways that community members and city planners make sense of bike infrastructure development in Chicago, Illinois. Qualitative interviews and participant observation were employed to clarify the community context of bike lane development in a gentrifying area of the city. We find that community engagement is a critical component of promoting the acceptance and use of bike infrastructure and discuss the role of a community bike shop in facilitating community engagement around bicycling in the neighbourhood of Humboldt Park, home to the second largest Puerto Rican community in the USA.},

The paper draws upon the results of surveys carried out as part of a project for the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions ( DETR) to investigate the potential for switching short car trips to other modes in Great Britain. The paper commences by considering the various approaches used to look at why people travel by car and, from these, concludes that there is a need to examine the behaviour underlying specific real trips by car. This is followed by a description of the survey methodology used in the project which forms the core of this paper. Then the evidence on why people used their cars for a set of real short trips identified in the surveys is presented. This is considered in terms of a number of dimensions including age, sex, and trip purpose. This is followed by a discussion of the alternatives to the car that drivers say that they might adopt and the factors which they say would make them consider switching to these alternatives.},

abstract = {In previous studies we described enzyme(s) from Escherichia coli that transfer two 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate (KDO) residues from two CMP-KDO molecules to a tetraacyldisaccharide-1,4'-bis-phosphate precursor of lipid A, termed lipid IVA (Brozek, K. A., Hosaka, K., Robertson, A. D., and Raetz, C. R. H. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 6956-6966). The product, designated (KDO)2-IVA, can be prepared in milligram quantities and/or radiolabeled with 32P at position 4' of the IVA moiety. We now demonstrate the presence of enzymes in E. coli extracts that transfer laurate and/or myristate residues from lauroyl or myristoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) to (KDO)2-IVA. Thioesters of coenzyme A are not substrates. The cytosolic fraction catalyzes rapid acylation with lauroyl-ACP, but not with myristoyl, R-3-hydroxymyristoyl, palmitoyl, or palmitoleoyl-ACP. The membrane fraction transfers both laurate and myristate to (KDO)2-IVA. Evidence for the enzymatic acylation of (KDO)2-IVA is provided by (a) conversion of [4'-32P](KDO)2-IVA to more rapidly migrating products in the presence of the appropriate acyl-ACP, (b) incorporation of [1-14C]laurate or [1-14C]myristate into these metabolites in the presence of (KDO)2-IVA, (c) fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry, and (d) 1H NMR spectroscopy. At protein concentrations less than 0.5 mg/ml, the acylation of (KDO)2-IVA by the cytoplasmic fraction is absolutely dependent upon the addition of exogenous acyl-ACP. These acyltransferases cannot utilize lipid IVA as a substrate, demonstrating that they possess novel KDO recognition domains. The unusual substrate specificity of these enzymes provides compelling evidence for their involvement in lipid A biosynthesis. Depending on the conditions it is possible to acylate (KDO)2-IVA with 1 or 2 lauroyl residues, with 1 or 2 myristoyl residues, or with 1 of each.},

West Yorkshire, associated with the inmigration and consumption practices of relatively affluent households. In doing so, we address the knowledge gap identified by Phillips (J. Rural Studies 9 (1993) 123) relating to the gentrification of rural locations. The term 'rural greentrification' is suggested to emphasise the varying cultural predilections of in-migrant households in the consumption of 'green' spaces. More specifically, a geography of greentrification is identified in the locale, which encompasses two socio-spatial relationships: 'village' and 'remote'. These are interpreted as distinct constructions of rural 'habitus' and thus exemplify the significance of Hebden Bridge as a special place, where the multiple appeals and meanings of different representations of greentrified Pennine rurality enable cultural and social differentiation. The findings reaffirm the value of viewing the rural as a socio-cultural construct, tied to place and time, which is specific to individuals and social groups. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Multiple and varied benefits have been suggested for increased neighborhood walkability. However, spatial inequalities in neighborhood walkability likely exist and may be attributable, in part, to residential segregation. OBJECTIVE Utilizing a spatial demographic perspective, we evaluated potential spatial inequalities in walkable neighborhood amenities across census tracts in Boston, MA (US). METHODS The independent variables included minority racial/ethnic population percentages and percent of families in poverty. Walkable neighborhood amenities were assessed with a composite measure. Spatial autocorrelation in key study variables were first calculated with the Global Moran's I statistic. Then, Spearman correlations between neighborhood socio-demographic characteristics and walkable neighborhood amenities were calculated as well as Spearman correlations accounting for spatial autocorrelation. We fit ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and spatial autoregressive models, when appropriate, as a final step. RESULTS Significant positive spatial autocorrelation was found in neighborhood socio-demographic characteristics (e.g. census tract percent Black), but not walkable neighborhood amenities or in the OLS regression residuals. Spearman correlations between neighborhood socio-demographic characteristics and walkable neighborhood amenities were not statistically significant, nor were neighborhood socio-demographic characteristics significantly associated with walkable neighborhood amenities in OLS regression models. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that there is residential segregation in Boston and that spatial inequalities do not necessarily show up using a composite measure. COMMENTS Future research in other geographic areas (including international contexts) and using different definitions of neighborhoods (including small-area definitions) should evaluate if spatial inequalities are found using composite measures but also should use measures of specific neighborhood amenities.},

abstract = {This paper presents a dynamic model of international tourism demand to Canary Islands. The empirical analysis exploits the panel structure of the dataset (for the 15 most important countries of origin of tourists over the period 1992-2002) by a Generalized Method of Moments estimation of a dynamic model taking into account unobserved country-specific effects. The preferred model is the GMM-DIFF proposed by Arellano and Bond, however other models are also shown for comparison. A dynamic model where the lagged dependent variable is included as regressor is used to obtain short-run and long-run elasticities. Problems arising from the non-stationarity of data are dealt with by using a model in first differences. The estimated coefficient for the lagged depended variable is always significant and may reflect a high degree of consumer loyalty or an important effect of word of mouth in determining demand of international tourism. In brief, the results suggests that tourism demand to Canary Islands must be considered as a luxury good and is highly dependent on the evolution of relative prices and cost of travel between origin and destination country. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Background: Many youth fail to meet the recommended guidelines for physical activity. Walking and cycling, forms of active travel, have the potential to contribute significantly towards overall physical activity levels. Recent research examining the associations between physical activity and the environment has shown that environmental factors play a role in determining behaviour in children and adolescents. However, links between the environment and active travel have received less attention. Methods: Twenty four studies were identified which examined the associations between the environment (perceived or objectively measured) and active travel among youth aged 5–18 years. Findings were categorised according to the location of the environmental measure examined; attributes of the neighbourhood, destination and the route between home and destination. Results: Results from the reviewed studies indicated that youth active travel is positively associated with social interactions, facilities to assist active travel and urban form in the neighbourhood as well as shorter route length and road safety en-route. A conceptual framework is presented which highlights the associations between active travel behaviours and environmental factors, drawing upon both existing and hypothesised relationships. Conclusion: We provide a review of the available literature and present a novel theoretical framework that integrates the environment into the wider decision making process around travel choices for children and adolescents. Further work should explore associations where gaps in understanding have been identified, and account for the main moderators of behaviour so hypothesised associations can be confirmed.},

The 33 questions included bicycle type and equipment, distribution of bicycle trips by purpose (e.g., work, on-road recreation), total distance cycled, commuting habits, accidents, and demographic data. The survey was designed to update one done by Kaplan in 1975. By the March 31, 1997, deadline over 2,400 (51{\%}) had been returned. Of these, 19{\%} were rejected due to incompleteness or inconsistent responses, leaving 1,956 valid surveys. The "average" respondent was a 48-year-old, married (66{\%}) male (80{\%}) professional (48{\%}) who rode 4670 km in 1996. Just over 9{\%} reported having had a serious crash (resulting in at least {\$}50 of property damage or medical expense) in 1996. Based on the experience reported by these cyclists, the average cyclist in this group could be expected to ride for 11 years before having such a crash. Falls accounted for 59{\%} of the incidents, whereas running into a fixed object happened 14{\%} of the time. Moving motor vehicles were involved in 11{\%} of the crashes and another bicycle in 9{\%}. A relative danger index is calculated that shows that streets with bike lanes have a significantly lower crash rate than either major or minor streets without any bicycle facilities (38{\%} and 56{\%}, respectively). Multiuse trails have a crash rate about 40{\%} greater than would be expected based on the kilometers cycled on them, whereas cycling on the sidewalk is extremely dangerous.},

This narrative is now commonplace, and widely applied both to neighborhood revitalization and urban competition for ‘talent'.

In order to allocate limited health care resources rationally, it is necessary to elucidate the economic burden of obesity.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: To estimate the direct costs related to the treatment of and research into obesity in Canada in 1997.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The prevalence of obesity (body mass index of 27 or greater) in Canada was determined using data from the National Population Health Survey, 1994-1995. Ten comorbidities of obesity were identified from the medical literature. A population attributable fraction (PAF) was calculated for each comorbidity with data from large cohort studies to determine the extent to which each comorbidity and its management costs were attributable to obesity. The direct cost of each comorbidity was determined using data from the Canadian Institute of Health Information (for direct expenditure categories) and from Health Canada (for the proportion of expenditure category attributable to the comorbidity). This prevalence-based approach identified the direct costs of hospital care, physician services, services of other health professionals, drugs, other health care and health research. For each comorbidity, the cost attributable to obesity was determined by multiplying the PAF by the total direct cost of the comorbidity. The overall impact of obesity was estimated as the sum of the PAF-weighted costs of treating the comorbidities. A sensitivity analysis was completed on both the estimated costs and the PAFs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The total direct cost of obesity in Canada in 1997 was estimated to be over {\$}1.8 billion. This corresponded to 2.4{\%} of the total health care expenditures for all diseases in Canada in 1997. The sensitivity analysis revealed that the total cost could be as high as {\$}3.5 billion or as low as {\$}829.4 million; this corresponded to 4.6{\%} and 1.1{\%} respectively of the total health care expenditures in 1997. When the contributions of the comorbidities to the total cost were considered, the 3 largest contributors were hypertension ({\$}656.6 million), type 2 diabetes mellitus ({\$}423.2 million) and coronary artery disease ({\$}346.0 million).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nINTERPRETATION: A considerable proportion of health care dollars is devoted to the treatment and management of obesity-related comorbidities in Canada. Further research into the therapeutic benefits and cost-effectiveness of management strategies for obesity is required. It is anticipated that the prevention and treatment of obesity will have major positive effects on the overall cost of health care.},

abstract = {Accessibility has become established as a mainstream policy goal in the service of the UK Government's aims of achieving greater social inclusion and social justice. It is argued that a better understanding of the relationship between conceptualisations of accessibility and these policy aims would be of value in understanding the potential of accessibility to contribute to policy. The aim of this paper is to contribute to this understanding. The paper discusses a conceptual fram ework placing accessibility centrally in the social justice and social inclusion agenda. The location of the idea of accessibility in the rural context, and as a 'rural challenge', is traced. Its relationship with welfare geography, and its essentially normative nature, are discussed, and connections with need are made. It is suggested that there is not just one account, either of what, in terms of accessibility, people 'need', or what they experience. Neither can there be just one account of what accessibility people 'should have'. The ideas of 'absolute' and 'relative' accessibility are referred to. A 'nested' framework is set out which relates social inclusion and accessibility, in turn, to social justice. Alternative philosophies of social justice are explored, and accessibility is discussed in the contexts of hilosophical positions on needs, rights, wants and deserts. The development of accessibility as a policy element is analysed. Setti ng greater accessibility as a goal is a potentially powerful driver of policy because it requires that policy sectors interact: Otherwise the goal of achieving greater accessibility as a means of greater social inclusion and social justice cannot be fully attained. It is concluded that the new narrative of accessibility, if itself soundly conceptualised, is a sine qua non for the social justice project. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Background: This study examined whether characteristics of the
residential built environment (i.e. population density, level of mixed
land use, connectivity, accessibility of facilities, accessibility of
green) contributed to educational inequalities in walking and cycling
among adults.
Methods: Data from participants (32-82 years) of the 2011 survey of the
Dutch population-based GLOBE study were used (N = 2375). Highest
attained educational level (independent variable) and walking for
transport, cycling for transport, walking in leisure time and cycling in
leisure time (dependent variables) were self-reported in the survey.
GIS-systems were used to obtain spatial data on residential built
environment characteristics. A four-step mediation-based analysis with
log-linear regression models was used to examine to contribution of the
residential built environment to educational inequalities in walking and
cycling.
Results: As compared to the lowest educational group, the highest
educational group was more likely to cycle for transport (RR 1.13, 95{\%}
CI 1.04-1.23), walk in leisure time (RR 1.12, 95{\%} CI 1.04-1.21), and
cycle in leisure time (RR 1.12, 95{\%} CI 1.03-1.22). Objective built
environment characteristics were related to these outcomes, but
contributed minimally to educational inequalities in walking and
cycling. On the other hand, compared to the lowest educational group,
the highest educational group was less likely to walk for transport (RR
0.91, 95{\%} CI 0.82-1.01), which could partly be attributed to
differences in the built environment.
Conclusion: This study found that objective built environment
characteristics contributed minimally to educational inequalities in
walking and cycling in the Netherlands.},

abstract = {This paper, using longitudinal data for 633 part-time bicycle commuters, investigates day-to-day decisions to commute by bicycle. Previous research has investigated mode choice, travel destination, and other travel choices for 1 day only. However, it cannot be assumed that travel choices do not vary from day to day and that most individuals travel by the same transportation mode every day. Day-to-day decisions to cycle are affected by work characteristics, commute journey characteristics, and weather conditions. More specifically, workers wearing business attire, needing to transport goods, needing a car during office hours, having longer commute distances, commuting in the dark, and facing a higher wind speed or a more or longer duration of rain are less likely to commute by bicycle. Positive effects were found for temperature and the duration of sunshine. The results show that factors that can differ on a daily basis largely influence bicycle mode choice from day to day. The results show that two groups of part-time cyclists exist: occasional cyclists and frequent cyclists. Whereas the decisions of occasional cyclists to commute by bicycle are more affected by positive weather conditions, frequent cyclists are discouraged from cycling by more practical barriers, including wind speed and the need to be at multiple locations.},

In order to allocate limited health care resources rationally, it is necessary to elucidate the economic burden of obesity.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: To estimate the direct costs related to the treatment of and research into obesity in Canada in 1997.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The prevalence of obesity (body mass index of 27 or greater) in Canada was determined using data from the National Population Health Survey, 1994-1995. Ten comorbidities of obesity were identified from the medical literature. A population attributable fraction (PAF) was calculated for each comorbidity with data from large cohort studies to determine the extent to which each comorbidity and its management costs were attributable to obesity. The direct cost of each comorbidity was determined using data from the Canadian Institute of Health Information (for direct expenditure categories) and from Health Canada (for the proportion of expenditure category attributable to the comorbidity). This prevalence-based approach identified the direct costs of hospital care, physician services, services of other health professionals, drugs, other health care and health research. For each comorbidity, the cost attributable to obesity was determined by multiplying the PAF by the total direct cost of the comorbidity. The overall impact of obesity was estimated as the sum of the PAF-weighted costs of treating the comorbidities. A sensitivity analysis was completed on both the estimated costs and the PAFs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The total direct cost of obesity in Canada in 1997 was estimated to be over {\$}1.8 billion. This corresponded to 2.4{\%} of the total health care expenditures for all diseases in Canada in 1997. The sensitivity analysis revealed that the total cost could be as high as {\$}3.5 billion or as low as {\$}829.4 million; this corresponded to 4.6{\%} and 1.1{\%} respectively of the total health care expenditures in 1997. When the contributions of the comorbidities to the total cost were considered, the 3 largest contributors were hypertension ({\$}656.6 million), type 2 diabetes mellitus ({\$}423.2 million) and coronary artery disease ({\$}346.0 million).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nINTERPRETATION: A considerable proportion of health care dollars is devoted to the treatment and management of obesity-related comorbidities in Canada. Further research into the therapeutic benefits and cost-effectiveness of management strategies for obesity is required. It is anticipated that the prevention and treatment of obesity will have major positive effects on the overall cost of health care.},

abstract = {Bicycle use varies strongly between countries, and even between municipalities within the same country substantial variations may exist. This paper analyses to what extent municipality policies matter in explaining these variations. It appears that most of the inter-municipality variation in bicycle use is related to physical aspects such as altitude differences and city size, and features of the population (share of youngsters). Differences in ethnic composition also appear to matter. Important policy-related variables are: the number of stops cyclists have to make on their routes; hindrances in road use; and safety of cyclists. In addition the relative position of bicycles with respect to cars (speed, parking costs) also appears to matter. These results shed light on various components of the cyclists' generalised costs, such as those related to accidents and physical efforts, that are not usually considered. We also conclude that cultural tradition, possibly related to ethnicity deserves a more explicit role in travel surveys and the analysis of travel behaviour than it usually receives. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Cycling confers transport, health and environmental benefits, and bicycle sharing systems are an increasingly popular means of promoting urban cycling. Following the launch of the London bicycle sharing system (LBSS) in 2010, women and residents of deprived areas were under-represented among initial users. This paper examines how the profile of users has changed across the scheme's first 3 years, using total-population registration and usage data. We find that women still make fewer than 20{\%} of all 'registered-use' LBSS trips, although evidence from elsewhere suggests that the introduction of 'casual' use has encouraged a higher overall female share of trips. The proportion of trips by registered users from 'highly-deprived areas' (in the top tenth nationally for income deprivation) rose from 6{\%} to 12{\%}. This was due not only to the 2012 LBSS extension to some of London's poorest areas, but also to a steadily increasing share of trips by residents of highly-deprived areas in the original LBSS zone. Indirect evidence suggests, however, that the twofold increase in LBSS prices in January 2013 has disproportionately discouraged casual-use trips among residents of poorer areas. We conclude that residents in deprived areas can and do use bicycle sharing systems if these are built in their local areas, and may do so progressively more over time, but only if the schemes remain affordable relative to other modes.},

The presence of a striped lane or separated path can increase a cyclist's perception of safety. With growing concerns over traffic congestion and vehicle pollution, public policy makers are increasingly promoting bicycling as an alternative for commuting and other utilitarian trip purposes. States and local spending on bicycle facilities has increased significantly over the past decade. Previous studies have linked higher levels of bicycle commuting to various demographic and geographic variables. At least one analysis showed that cities with higher levels of bicycle infrastructure (lanes and paths) also saw higher levels of bicycle commuting. This research affirms that finding by analyzing data from 35 large cities across the U.S. This cross-sectional analysis improves on previous research by including a larger sample of cities, not including predominantly ‘college towns,' and using consistent data from the Census 2000 Supplemental Survey. While the analysis has limitations, it does support the assertion that new bicycle lanes in large cities will be used by commuters},

In the Brighton trial, three-quarters of those who were loaned an e-bike used them at least once a week. Across the sample as a whole, average usage was in the order of 15–20 miles per week, and was accompanied by an overall reduction in car mileage of 20{\%}. At the end of the trial, 38{\%} participants expected to cycle more in the future, and at least 70{\%} said that they would like to have an e-bike available for use in the future, and would cycle more if this was the case. This is consistent with the results of the European literature which shows that when e-bikes are made available, they get used; that a proportion of e-bike trips typically substitutes for car use; and that many people who take part in trials become interested in future e-bike use, or cycling more generally.},

Recent studies attribute this gap to insufficient use of energy-efficient technologies by occupants. This paper focuses on the governance of domestic photovoltaic (PV) systems in the UK during the provision stage, an overlooked area in the previous energy-efficiency studies that have mainly focused on PV adoption and practices by occupants, but only after installation. The notion of translation in Actor Network Theory (ANT) is used to analyse how a network of PV provision actants decides the system design and integration into homes, and how this in turn conditions household participation in this network. Semi-structured interviews and video tours used in four participative community and two non-participative community case studies reveal the impact of non-human actants in terms of how PV scripts and practices are formed by PV professionals. The finding also shows that the nominated 'procurement occupants' were the key mediators in the participative projects, while the housing developers were the key mediators in the non-participative projects.},

abstract = {Profitability has long eluded America's public transit industry. Today, few transit routes in the nation cover more than one-half of their fully allocated costs through farebox returns. Nor is profitability something that many people expect or even want public transit to achieve. Indeed, mass transit has a much larger social mandate -- to provide mobility to the poor, young, old, and indigent; to reduce traffic congestion along heavily traveled corridors, along with fuel consumption and air pollution; to encourage and reinforce relatively dense and environmentally efficient land development patterns; and to provide back-up transportation for even those who normally drive, such as during periods of severe oil shortages. Interest in improving the fiscal health of public transit has heightened in recent years in the wake of federal subsidy cuts, greater competition transit's customer base, such as declining real gasoline prices and the suburbanization of jobs. While no one is calling for transit agencies to run in the black, it is encouraging nonetheless that some urban transit routes do make a profit. Given the financial pressures facing America's public transit industry, it is instructive to put these routes "under a microscope" and probe some of their service and ridership characteristics. The aim of this article is to do so. As part of a larger study on competition in the urban transit sector, profitable publicly operated bus routes were found in three metropolitan areas: Philadelphia, Washington, D.C. and Minneapolis- St. Paul. While profit-making public transit routes surely operate in other places as well, such as New York City, the absence of reliable ridership, operations, and cost data at a route-by-route level restricted the size of the sample frame. In all, data on the highest ridership routes of transit properties in 25 of the nation's largest metropolitan areas were compiled for both local and express bus services. Based on the most models developed, less than 1 percent of all routes studied were found to cover their fully allocated costs (i.e., generate a profit). The bulk of this article profiles the profitable bus routes in terms of those attributes that appear to effect demand for service.},

While active travel has been shown to be associated with features of the built environment such as density and land-use mix, it is also associated with walking and cycling accessibility—which we designate as active accessibility. However, the measurement of active accessibil- ity is not straightforward and it can represent significantly different features of the built environment. This paper presents an extensive review of published research that measures active accessibility. We classified the literature into four categories based on the methodology used: distance-based, gravity-based or potential, topological or infra- structure-based, and walkability and walk score-type measures. A fifth category was created to classify outliers consisting of distinct methodological approaches or hybrids of the four main categories. We argue that almost all of these methods have conceptual and computational limitations, and that there are inconsistencies in the use of concepts and terms. Furthermore, no sensitivity analysis was carried out on the selected parameters. We conclude by presenting some guidelines that might improve the value and clarity of active accessibility research, theory, and practice.},

Specifically, we discuss differences between places with established cycling cultures and those with newer cycling cultures. Drawing on concepts from practice theory we discuss the role that cultures of cycling play within the four places, and suggest how the meanings of cycling, including its association with other social identities, are connected to the materials and competences seen as necessary for cycling. Our research highlights the embedding of transport in local as well as national cultures, and the associated need for policy-makers to take culture seriously in considering how to shift transport practices. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Encouraging cycling, as part of a wider sustainable mobility strategy, is an increasingly common objective in transport planning institutions worldwide. Emerging evidence shows that providing appropriate high-quality infrastructure can boost local cycling rates. To maximize the benefits and cost-effectiveness of new infrastructure, it is important to build in the right places. Cycle paths, for example, will have the greatest impact if they are constructed along 'desire lines' of greatest latent demand. The Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) seeks to inform such decisions by providing an evidence-based support tool that models current and potential future distributions and volumes of cycling across cities and regions. This paper describes this model and its application to case study cities in England. Origin-destination (OD) data, combined with quantitative information at the level of administrative zones, form the basis of the model, which estimates cycling potential as a function of route distance, hilliness and other factors at the OD and area level. Multiple scenarios were generated and interactively displayed. These were: 'Government Target', in which the rate of cycling doubles in England; 'Gender Equality', in which women cycle as much as men; 'Go Dutch', in which English people cycle as much as people in the Netherlands; and 'E-bikes', an exploratory analysis of increasing the distance people are willing to cycle due to new technology. The model is freely available online and can be accessed at [geo8.webarch.net/master/](http://geo8.webarch.net/master/). This paper also explains how the PCT's open source approach allows it to be deployed in new cities and countries. We conclude that the method presented has potential to assist with planning for cycling-dominated cities worldwide, which can in turn assist with the global transition away from fossil fuels.},

In light of these benefits, a growing number of cities throughout the world are implementing policies to promote cycling, though they continue to struggle to identify the most effective ways to spend their limited resources. In response, transport researchers are also increasingly focusing their efforts on cycling, addressing a broader range of questions than in the past, including: how much cycling is there? What strategies will increase cycling? What are the benefits of increased cycling? This paper reviews the challenges that researchers face in providing answers to these questions by highlighting limitations of the exist- ing research, identifying remaining research needs, and discussing methodological considerations for addressing those needs. Investments in cycling research can pay off by providing a basis for identify- ing the most effective strategies for increasing cycling and providing more accurate estimates of the benefits that would accrue.},

@article{Marsden2017,
abstract = {This paper critiques the state of the art approaches to studying transportation policy. It does so through analysing 100 papers sampled from the two leading policy journals in the transportation literature. On applying two different frameworks for understanding policy, the review finds that only 13{\%} of papers consider specific aspects of the policy cycle, that 60{\%} focus on ‘tools' for policy, and that two-thirds of papers did not engage with real-world policy examples or policy makers and focussed on quantitative analysis alone. We argue that these findings highlight the persistence of the technical-rational model within the transportation literature. This model, and the numerous traditions and disciplines that have fed into it have an important role to play in developing the transportation evidence base. However, we argue there are important questions of governance; such as context, power, resources and legitimacy, that are largely being ignored in the literature as it stands. The substantial lack of engagement with governance issues and debates means that as a field we are artificially, but more importantly, disproportionately generating a science of applied policy making which is unlikely to be utilised because of the distance between it and the realities on the ground. The paper identifies analytical approaches deployed readily in other fields that could be used to address some of the key deficiencies.},

The model combines Revealed Preference (RP) and Stated Preference (SP) data to form a very large and comprehensive model. RP data from the National Travel Survey was combined with a specially commissioned RP survey. A number of SP surveys were also undertaken to examine the effects of different types of en-route and trip end cycle facilities and financial measures to encourage cycling. The development of the model is described in detail. The model was used to forecast trends in urban commuting shares over time and to predict the impacts of different measures to encourage cycling. Of the en-route cycle facilities, a completely segregated cycleway was forecast to have the greatest impact, but even the unfeasible scenario of universal provision of such facilities would only result in a 55{\%} increase in cycling and a slight reduction in car commuting. Payments for cycling to work were found to be highly effective with a {\pounds}2 daily payment almost doubling the level of cycling. The most effective policy would combine improvements in en-route facilities, a daily payment to cycle to work and comprehensive trip end facilities and this would also have a significant impact on car commuting. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This article shows how the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany have made bicycling a safe, convenient and practical way to get around their cities. The analysis relies on national aggregate data as well as case studies of large and small cities in each country. The key to achieving high levels of cycling appears to be the provision of separate cycling facilities along heavily travelled roads and at intersections, combined with traffic calming of most residential neighbourhoods. Extensive cycling rights of way in the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany are complemented by ample bike parking, full integration with public transport, comprehensive traffic education and training of both cyclists and motorists, and a wide range of promotional events intended to generate enthusiasm and wide public support for cycling. In addition to their many pro-bike policies and programmes, the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany make driving expensive as well as inconvenient in central cities through a host of taxes and restrictions on car ownership, use and parking. Moreover, strict land-use policies foster compact, mixed-use developments that generate shorter and thus more bikeable trips. It is the coordinated implementation of this multi-faceted, mutually reinforcing set of policies that best explains the success of these three countries in promoting cycling. For comparison, the article portrays the marginal status of cycling in the UK and the USA, where only about 1{\%} of trips are by bike. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {The focus for interventions and research on physical activity has moved away from vigorous activity to moderate-intensity activities, such as walking. In addition, a social ecological approach to physical activity research and practice is recommended. This approach considers the influence of the environment and policies on physical activity. Although there is limited empirical published evidence related to the features of the physical environment that influence physical activity, urban planning and transport agencies have developed policies and strategies that have the potential to influence whether people walk or cycle in their neighbourhood. This paper presents the development of a framework of the potential environmental influences on walking and cycling based on published evidence and policy literature, interviews with experts and a Delphi study. The framework includes four features: functional, safety, aesthetic and destination; as well as the hypothesised factors that contribute to each of these features of the environment. In addition, the Delphi experts determined the perceived relative importance of these factors. Based on these factors, a data collection tool will be developed and the frameworks will be tested through the collection of environmental information on neighbourhoods, where data on the walking and cycling patterns have been collected previously. Identifying the environmental factors that influence walking and cycling will allow the inclusion of a public health perspective as well as those of urban planning and transport in the design of built environments.},

More specifically, this paper discusses recent accomplishments in terms of modeling accessibility and provides a systematic and comprehensive literature review of their application in empirical studies of health care delivery. Based on this literature review a research agenda is put forward, identifying knowledge gaps that transport researchers can help to fill. These knowledge gaps pertain to the need for more spatially disaggregated, individualized and temporally-aware accessibility metrics, more sophisticated geocomputational tools to operationalize such metrics and improved measurement of equity considerations in empirical research.},

We aim to bridge the discrepancy between the assumptions behind the analysis for supply side decisions and the modelling of the demand side mobility behaviour that still exists in theory. With an agent-based approach to consumer spatial behaviour we study the impact of increasing mobility of consumers on the logistical strategy of retailers. In an artificially generated world imitating the spatial configuration of a big city, we study different scenarios about consumer mobility. We focus on the impact of commuting behaviour and on the resulting effect of different cognitive maps that influence a consumer's store choice. We do not only study the model's numerical results but also throw a look on the spatial outcome. The main result is that we provide greater insight in emerging retail location patterns as a result of changing consumer spatial behaviour and that this interplay between consumer mobility and location strategies can be thoroughly studied with an agentbased modelling and simulation approach. {\textcopyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},
