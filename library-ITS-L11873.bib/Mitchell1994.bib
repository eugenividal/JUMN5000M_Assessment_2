abstract = {The applications and limitations of current geodemographic classifications for the identification, segmentation, and targeting of consumer markets are examined. Future developments and opportunities draw on the results of a Delphi study conducted with market analysis industry experts. Issues discussed include factors inhibiting marketing development, market potential, 1991 census, computer developments, noncensus databases, bespoke classifications, education, and Europeanization. The collective view was that the industry appears poised for a few boom years, following the release of the 1991 census data. The most important long-term factor is the continued development of personal computer-based market analysis, which is enhanced by the continued fall in hardware and software costs. The incorporation of syndicated lifestyle, psychographic, and behavioral data into systems will be complemented by the growth of in-house client bespoke systems.},
