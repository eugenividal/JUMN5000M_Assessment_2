abstract = {Rapid motorization and population growth in many Latin American cities has resulted in unprecedented urban transportation challenges, with lower income populations disproportionately facing constraints to mobility as well as externalities like air pollution, traffic accidents, and climate change. The construction of bicycle lane networks has been identified as an effective tool for increasing citizen's mobility and accessibility as well as combatting the effects of motorization, but in cities where bicycle lane networks exist, it is not known if they have benefitted different income groups equally. This paper assesses the extent to which bicycle lane provisioning has been equitable among neighbourhoods in Rio de Janeiro and Curitiba. Both cities were found to have more than twice the supply of bicycle lanes in the wealthiest quintile than the lowest-income quintile relative to area and population. A network analysis using a Level of Traffic Safety classification to categorize roads found that wealthier areas have more commercial areas accessible along safer cycling routes. Implications for cycling policy and future research are discussed.},
