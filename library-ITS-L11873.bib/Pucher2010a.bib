abstract = {A broad overview of the role walking and cycling can play in making cities healthier is provided. The scientific evidence of the health benefits of walking and cycling is outlined and variations in walking and cycling levels in Europe, North America, and Australia compared. A range of government policies is needed to encourage more walking and cycling: safe and convenient infrastructure such as sidewalks, crosswalks, bike paths and lanes, and intersection crossings; traffic calming of residential neighbourhoods; integration with public transport; land-use policies that foster compact, mixed-use developments; people-friendly urban design; improved traffic education; strict enforcement of traffic regulations; and reductions in motor vehicle speed limits.},
