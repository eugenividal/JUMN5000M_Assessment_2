abstract = {To enhance social equity, three important sustainable transportation initiatives have been introduced in Bogot{\'{a}}. Spatial information and GIS have been used to analyze levels of inequality in access to these initiatives. The results show that the TransMilenio BRT offers equal access for all socio-economic strata (SES). Nonetheless, its modal share is low for the poor due to affordability issues. The Cicloruta bicycle network and Ciclov{\'{i}}a recreational program do not offer equal access for all SES, especially for the lower SES. Their users, however, mainly come from low and middle income SES. Marginal network extensions can improve equality in access. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]},
