abstract = {Previous research on walking and cycling as primary modes of local access for local centres in metropolitan areas, have focused on the role of the street network, urban design quality, socio-economic characteristics and urban form as predisposing factors to walking and cycling. A neglected factor is that of terrain as an impedance to walking and cycling for access to a local centre. Whilst most suburban areas in large metropolitan areas tend to be in locations with minimal topographical variations, there are substantial portions of Australian cities that are hilly and have local streets with gradients that are steep enough to present a significant challenge to walking and cycling. This paper details the methodologies used and the results of a comparative analysis of two metropolitan Adelaide suburbs (Salisbury and Golden Grove) with public transit interchanges that service a predominantly residential neighbourhood precinct within their respective local catchments of approximately a 1.6km radius, to determine the impact of topography on local transport modal choice. Both Salisbury and Golden Grove are located approximately 22km from the centre of Adelaide city centre in Adelaide{\&}rsquo;s north-eastern suburbs and both have similar intensity of retailing activity and style and density of residential development. However, Golden Grove is extremely hilly with elevations varying by up to 90m up to 214m, whereas Salisbury is largely level at an elevation of approximately 35m. This paper concludes with transport and urban planning policy implications of considering the influence of topography on local modal transport choices in suburban centres.},
