abstract = {This paper examines the processes of change in two 'rural' environs of Hebden Bridge. West Yorkshire, associated with the inmigration and consumption practices of relatively affluent households. In doing so, we address the knowledge gap identified by Phillips (J. Rural Studies 9 (1993) 123) relating to the gentrification of rural locations. The term 'rural greentrification' is suggested to emphasise the varying cultural predilections of in-migrant households in the consumption of 'green' spaces. More specifically, a geography of greentrification is identified in the locale, which encompasses two socio-spatial relationships: 'village' and 'remote'. These are interpreted as distinct constructions of rural 'habitus' and thus exemplify the significance of Hebden Bridge as a special place, where the multiple appeals and meanings of different representations of greentrified Pennine rurality enable cultural and social differentiation. The findings reaffirm the value of viewing the rural as a socio-cultural construct, tied to place and time, which is specific to individuals and social groups. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.
