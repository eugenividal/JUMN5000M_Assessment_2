abstract = {Every day I look around London and see that more and more people are now travelling by bike. Since 2000 the number of cyclists on the Capital's major roads has more than doubled – up nine per cent in the year 2008-09 alone. Yet this is just the start. I'm determined to turn London into a cyclised city – a civilised city where people can ride their bikes safely and easily in a pleasant environment. Cycling, with all its social, environmental, health and financial benefits, has an important role to play in the future of the Capital. Put simply, it's the best way to get around our city, and arguably the single most important tool for making London the best big city in the world.},
