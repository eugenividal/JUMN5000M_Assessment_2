abstract = {This document presents the results of analysis carried out to understand the potential for growth in cycle travel. The goal of this analysis is to better understand the nature of this potential, in terms of what type of trips, people and places offer the best opportunity for growth. The analysis aims to make the best use of available data to inform policy development – it has been carried out at TfL using existing data sources. This report does not seek to present a complete picture of all aspects of the potential for growth; in particular, there is potential beyond that identified by this analysis to increase cycling as a leisure activity, as a method of accessing other public transport modes, and for those visiting London. Nevertheless, the data provides a unique and fascinating insight into cycling potential, and can help the Mayor, TfL and London‟s boroughs to plan policy interventions that provide good value for money whilst meeting the needs of London residents.},
