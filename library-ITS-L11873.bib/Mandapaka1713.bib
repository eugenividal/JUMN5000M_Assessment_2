abstract = {Direct Marketing is the practice of delivering promotional messages directly to customers or prospects on an individual basis rather than using a mass medium. In this project, we build a finely tuned response model that helps a financial services company to select high quality receptive customers for their future campaigns and identify the important factors that influence the marketing campaign to effectively manage their resources. campaign data (45,211 observations and 18 variables) available on UC Irvine website with attributes of present {\&} past campaign information (communication type, contact duration, previous campaign outcome As part of data preparation, we had performed decision tree imputation to handle missing values and categorical recoding for reducing levels of class variables. In this study we had built several predictive models using SAS Enterprise Miner: Decision Tree, Neural Network, Logistic Regression and SVM Models to predict whether the customer responds to a loan offer by subscribing or not. The results showed that Stepwise Logistic Regression Model was the best when chosen based on the misclassification rate criteria. When the top 3 decile customers were selected based on the best model, the cumulative response rate was 14.5{\%} in contrast to the baseline response rate of 5{\%}. Further analysis showed that the customers are more likely to subscribe to the loan offer if they have the following characteristics: never been contacted in past, no default history, and provided cell phone as primary contact information.},
