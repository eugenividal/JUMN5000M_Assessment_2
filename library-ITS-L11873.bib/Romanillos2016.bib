abstract = {Big Data has begun to create significant impacts in urban and transport planning.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThis paper covers the explosion in data-driven research on cycling, most of which has occurred in$\backslash$r$\backslash$nthe last ten years. We review the techniques, objectives and findings of a growing number of$\backslash$r$\backslash$nstudies we have classified into three groups according to the nature of the data they are based on:$\backslash$r$\backslash$nGPS data (spatio-temporal data collected using the global positioning system (GPS)), live point$\backslash$r$\backslash$ndata and journey data. We discuss the movement from small-scale GPS studies to the ‘Big GPS'$\backslash$r$\backslash$ndata sets held by fitness and leisure apps or specific cycling initiatives, the impact of Bike Share Programmes$\backslash$r$\backslash$n(BSP) on the availability of timely point data and the potential of historical journey data for$\backslash$r$\backslash$ntrend analysis and pattern recognition. We conclude by pointing towards the possible new insights$\backslash$r$\backslash$nthrough combining these data sets with each other – and with more conventional health, socio-demographic or transport data.},
