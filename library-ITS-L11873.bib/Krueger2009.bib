abstract = {W ho should be invited to a focus group? How many people should par-ticipate? How should participants be identified? What does it take to get people to attend? Market research firms spend sizeable amounts of thought, time, and money refining their recruiting efforts. They know if they don't deliver enough of the right people for a focus group, their reputation in the business world suffers. They know the art of recruiting. In contrast, public sector organizations tend to underestimate the importance and difficulty of recruiting participants. Public and nonprofit organizations operate within a different environment. Most can't spend huge amounts of money on recruit-ing. They operate under different traditions, constraints, rules and procedures. Not-for-Profit Organizations Often Have Difficulty Recruiting Nonprofit and public organizations that do their own focus group recruiting often have difficulty, because they assume focus group participants are like volunteers. However, volunteers are typically more aware of and committed to the organization's mission than are others. Yet, these organizations often need to recruit people who aren't already committed to the issue and who have other interests and responsibilities competing for their time. Organizations underestimate how difficult it is to get participants to agree to attend, and they overestimate the likelihood that those who agree to attend will actually show up at the appointed time.},
