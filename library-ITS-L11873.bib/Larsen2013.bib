abstract = {ABSTRACT Concern over climate change, traffic congestion, and the health consequences of sedentary lifestyles has resulted in a surge of interest in cycling as an efficient form of sustainable transportation. In order to best serve the needs of current cyclists and attract future ones, methodologies are needed to objectively determine the optimum location of new cycling facilities. This article uses Montr{\'{e}}al, Canada, as a case study to demonstrate various methods for locating facilities. This research can be beneficial to transportation engineers and planners since it uses readily available data sources to recommend additions and improvements to a city's cycling infrastructure.
