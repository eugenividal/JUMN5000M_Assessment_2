abstract = {Background: This study examined whether characteristics of the
residential built environment (i.e. population density, level of mixed
land use, connectivity, accessibility of facilities, accessibility of
green) contributed to educational inequalities in walking and cycling
among adults.
Methods: Data from participants (32-82 years) of the 2011 survey of the
Dutch population-based GLOBE study were used (N = 2375). Highest
attained educational level (independent variable) and walking for
transport, cycling for transport, walking in leisure time and cycling in
leisure time (dependent variables) were self-reported in the survey.
GIS-systems were used to obtain spatial data on residential built
environment characteristics. A four-step mediation-based analysis with
log-linear regression models was used to examine to contribution of the
residential built environment to educational inequalities in walking and
cycling.
Results: As compared to the lowest educational group, the highest
educational group was more likely to cycle for transport (RR 1.13, 95{\%}
CI 1.04-1.23), walk in leisure time (RR 1.12, 95{\%} CI 1.04-1.21), and
cycle in leisure time (RR 1.12, 95{\%} CI 1.03-1.22). Objective built
environment characteristics were related to these outcomes, but
contributed minimally to educational inequalities in walking and
cycling. On the other hand, compared to the lowest educational group,
the highest educational group was less likely to walk for transport (RR
0.91, 95{\%} CI 0.82-1.01), which could partly be attributed to
differences in the built environment.
Conclusion: This study found that objective built environment
characteristics contributed minimally to educational inequalities in
walking and cycling in the Netherlands.},
