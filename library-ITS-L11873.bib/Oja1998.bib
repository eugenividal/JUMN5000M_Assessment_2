abstract = {The substantial health-enhancing potential of physical activity can be realised on population level best if people can incorporate physical activity into their daily life routines. Physically active commuting to and from work provides a promising mode for such activity. In a series of three studies we explored more specifically the population prevalence, the physiological effectiveness, and the promotional possibilities of commuting to work by walking and cycling in a mid-size Finnish town. The results of the questionnaire survey indicated that while about one-third of the working-age sample commuted by walking or cycling an additional one-quarter were in a position to either begin or increase physically active commuting. The controlled intervention study showed that this kind of moderate-intensity, high-frequency activity improved the health-related fitness and selected indices of metabolic health. The promotion project in a large industrial plant demonstrated that walking and cycling during work trips can be successfully promoted by relatively low cost measures. These experiences suggest that physically active commuting to work offers substantial potential as a health-enhancing measure for working-age population.},
