abstract = {This article examines changes in transport and land-use policies in Germany over the last 40 years that have encouraged more walking, bicycling and public transport use. It focuses on a case study of policy changes in the city of Freiburg, where over the last three decades, the number of bicycle trips tripled, public transport ridership doubled, and the share of trips by automobile declined from 38{\%} to 32{\%}. Since 1990, motorization rates have leveled-off and per-capita CO2 emissions from transport have fallenâ€”despite strong economic growth. The analysis ident- ifies policies that are transferable to car-oriented countries around the world.},
