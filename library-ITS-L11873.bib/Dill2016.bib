abstract = {The labeling and the categorizing of cyclists have been occurring for more than a century for a variety of purposes. This study examined a typology developed by the City of Portland, Oregon, that included four categories of cyclists: “the strong and the fearless,” “the enthused and confident,” “the interested but concerned,” and “no way, no how.” Unlike several other typologies, this widely referenced typology was intended to apply to all adults, regardless of their current cycling behavior. An analysis was conducted with data from a random phone survey (n 5 908) of adults in the Portland region. Adults were placed into one of the four categories primarily on the basis of their stated comfort level with cycling on a variety of facility types, their interest in cycling as transportation, and their physical ability to bicycle. Nearly all of the sampled population fit clearly into one of the four categories. A majority (56{\%}) of the region's population fit in the interested but concerned category, which was thought to be the key target market to increase the use of cycling as a form of transportation. The analysis indicated that a reduction in traffic speed and an increase in the separation between bicycles and motor vehicles (e.g., cycle tracks) might increase levels of comfort and cycling rates. Women and older adults were underrepresented among the more confident adults and those who currently cycled for transportation.},
